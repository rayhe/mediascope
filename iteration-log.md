## 2026-06-22 01:00 PT — Hour Type B: Guardian Tech Desk Deep Dive

**Focus:** Journalist/Publication Research — Guardian technology desk expansion

### What was improved:
1. **6 new journalist career histories** added to `profiles/careers/journalists.yaml`:
   - **Johana Bhuiyan** — Senior tech reporter/editor, Guardian US (Aug 2021–present). Career: POLITICO NY → BuzzFeed News → Recode → LA Times → Guardian. Surveillance of marginalized communities specialist.
   - **Blake Montgomery** — US tech editor, Guardian (Sep 2023–present). Career: EdSurge → BuzzFeed News → Daily Beast → Gizmodo → Guardian. 
   - **Samantha Oltman** — Brief Reworked AI series editor (Feb–Jun 2026). Career: Wired → BuzzFeed News → Recode/Vox EIC → Good Luck Media → Guardian → Bloomberg. Left after only 4 months.
   - **Julia Carrie Wong** — Former Guardian tech reporter (2015–2021). Facebook whistleblower (Sophie Zhang) coverage. Left tech beat for other topics.
   - **Kari Paul** — Former Guardian West Coast tech reporter (2019–2024). Left for art school in Paris.
   - **Hibaq Farah** — Former Guardian UK tech reporter (~2023–2024). Led TikTok moderation investigation. Left for NYT Opinion.

2. **Guardian profile (`profiles/guardian.yaml`) corrections:**
   - **REMOVED** Kiran Stacey from key_journalists — he is the Guardian's UK *policy editor* covering British politics, NOT a tech reporter. Was incorrectly listed as "US tech policy."
   - **ADDED** Blake Montgomery, Johana Bhuiyan as current tech desk staff
   - **ADDED** full editorial history: 4 notable arrivals (Milmo, Bhuiyan, Montgomery, Oltman), 4 notable departures (Wong, Paul, Farah, Oltman)
   - **UPDATED** editorial notes with turnover analysis: significant churn 2021–2026, core stability from Hern (UK, since 2013) and Milmo (global, since 2021)

3. **Editorial changes (`profiles/careers/editorial_changes.yaml`):**
   - Added 3 Guardian leadership entries: Montgomery hire (2023), Oltman hire (2026-02), Oltman departure (2026-06)

### Key discovery:
- **Samantha Oltman's 4-month Guardian tenure** is analytically interesting. She brought Recode/Kara Swisher editorial DNA to the Guardian's "Reworked" AI series, then left for Bloomberg after only ~4 months. This creates a natural experiment: did Guardian AI/work coverage tone shift during her Feb–Jun 2026 tenure? Her Wired → Recode → Guardian path also adds to the Condé Nast editorial pipeline analysis.
